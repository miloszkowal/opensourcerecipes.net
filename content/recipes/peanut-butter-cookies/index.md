ingredients:
  - 1 cup sugar
  - 1 cup peanut butter
  - 1 egg

directions:
  - Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
  - Stir the ingredients together until smooth.
  - Scoop onto a parchment or Silpat lined baking sheet. (Roll into 1" balls with your hands, if you do not have a scoop.)
  - Press down with the back of a fork and then press again from the opposite direction, to form the criss-cross pattern on top.
